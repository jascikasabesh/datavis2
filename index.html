        <h1><b>The Green Transition: Global Renewable Energy and Emissions </b></h1>
        <p>
          Australia is undergoing significant transformation in its energy sector as part of the global effort 
          to combat climate-change. "The Green Transition" focuses on reducing reliance on fossil fuels, 
          such as coal and natural gas, and increasing the usage of renewable energy resources. Historically, Australia's 
          energy production has been heavily dependent on carbon-intensive fuels, which has made it one of the highest per capita
          emitters of greenhouse gases globally. The burning of fossil fuels have contributed to rising carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in the atmosphere as well.
          These emissions are drivers of the effects climate change which has become evident through extreme weather events,
          heatwaves, wildfires, and biodiversity loss across the country.

      <p>
          This dashboard captures the evolutoin of renewable energy generation in Australia, providing insights into the growing
          contribution of various renewable sources to the national energy mix. It also visualises the share of renewable energy in 
          primary consumption, tracking how these developments align with efforts to lower greenhouse gas emissions. By exploring these trends, we can 
          understand Australias progress towards a sustainable, low-carbon future.

          <h2>A Look at Energy Consumption by Fuel Type </h2>
          <p> Australia is heavily reliant on fossil fuels, including coal, gas, and oil. This is evident across states like New South Wales, 
            Queensland and Victoria which have been centres for coal mining, providing cheap and reliable energy for domestic consumption and export. Gas plays a key role
            in Western Australia because of their natural gas reserves.
            While fossil fuels dominate most states, Tasmania is an exception for their abundant water resources and early investment in hydro infrastructure.
            Nevertheless, Australia is now making efforts to diversify its energy mix and to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels.

      <h2> Australia's Evolving Energy Mix</h2>
      <p> Australia is well-positioned to harness solar energy, while costal regions provide ample opportunity for wind power generation. 
        Over the past decade, renewable energy generation has increased dramatically, driven by substantial investments in wind and
        solar power. Large-scale and smaller-scale solar are becoming dominant contributors to Australia's energy mix. Hydroelective power was 
        a leading energy source, however its share declined as other technologies expanded. The aim is to gradually reduce fossil fuel generation. </p>

            <h2>Australia versus the World </h2>
            <p>
              Australia has made its transition to renewable energy slower compared to other countries. Whilst equipped with 
              abundany resources, it still lags behind global leaders like Brazil, Norway in terms of renewable energy as a percentage of total
              primary energy consumption. These countries have been able to harness their natural advantages, such as Bioenergy (Brazil) and Hydropower (Iceland).
              Globally, the transition to renewables have been more pronounced in countries with clear policy and government incentives, which Australia is still 
              working towards. Many low income countries 
              particularly in Africa and parts of Asia struggle to prioritise due to more immediate economic challenges, hence the lack of infrastructure in renewable 
              technologies.

          <h2>Carbon Footprint Challenge</h2>
          <p>
            Greenhouse gases include methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N20) and flourine gases, all of which trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere. These gases primarily come
            from burning fossil fuels for electricity, heat and transportation. The accumulation of these gases in the atmosphere has a negative effect 
            leading to more frequent extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and disruptions to ecosystems. Australia, while not a significant global
            emitter as countries like China it still contributes a substantial amount of gases due to heavy reliance to coal, gas and oil.

          <h2>The Burden of CO2</h2>
          <p>
            CO2 is a type of greenhouse gas and most importantly one of the largest emitters contributing to climate change, driving the increase in global temperatures and environmental consequences. Again they stem
            from the burning of fossil fuels. Australia is a prime example of this challenge. Despite having a relatively small population, it ranks high in per capita 
            emissions, largely because of its dependence on fossil fuels. Many lower income countries contribute to far less global emissions because of the lack of 
            industrial infrastructure. However, as these economies grow, there is a risk that their emissions could increase if they follow same fossil fuel heavy paths.
